Question,Answer
What is Machine Learning?,Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data.
What are the main types of Machine Learning?,"The main types of Machine Learning are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning."
How does Supervised Learning differ from Unsupervised Learning?,"Supervised Learning involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs, while Unsupervised Learning involves finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data."
Can you explain what a Neural Network is?,A Neural Network is a series of algorithms that attempts to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.
What is the role of data in Machine Learning?,"Data plays a crucial role in Machine Learning as it is used to train models, validate their accuracy, and test their predictions."
