question,answer
My code for EX07 is complete except for the word cloud portion. I am having trouble getting it installed and keep getting this error. Through the regular install or when I try to use a pip command in the terminal. Please let me know if you know how to resolve this issue.,You can also install through pycharm package.
Thank you for your quick response. Trying to install through PyCharm package is the method I am currently using and how I got the error in the image I sent. Do you know of anything else that could be the issue?,"I can not tell what’s the problem from the image you send. 
Did you install the package successfully now?"
"No, I do not have wordcloud installed. All other packages installed without a problem. I have tried shutting down and restarting pycharm, which I guess I will continue to do hoping it works before the due time today. I will also try to see if I can find anything online for this issue.","There’s another way to install: through terminal in pycharm, which requires you clear of your python path of your current project and use ‘-m pip install wordcloud ‘. 
This is a little complex, But if you know your python path in your current project，this is not a problem. "
"That’s, what I found online. I have attempted doing it that way but I most likely did that method wrong. I will continue to try both. Not really sure what the issue is. I assume this is not an issue for other students. Also, I am not sure if this means anything but I think the right side that gives a preview of wordcloud is off on my computer, at least compared to the other libraries:","This is what I would do if I want to install through terminal:
first find the python path in your console, then use the path to install your target package, "
"Can I please have the EM 624 midterm scheduled to a different time as well?
I have work right up until 6:30 and won't have a place to take the exam in time.","Yes, you can do that.
But the make up midterm test date is not set yet, you will get notification once we have the list."
I wanted to know If I can I present my code on jupyter notebook for the presentation?,"Sure you can, but you still need to submit a working py."
"This is regarding the final project I ve just run the code I have sumbitted yesterday I did a very small mistake of not closing a bracket . Which is causing syntax error ‘(‘ was never closed in line 106 
Can please add the bracket and sumbit my code ?",Sure!
"I have submitted my project report along with an ""ipynb file"". I couldn’t submit the "".py file "" as i was not getting the full results on the ""py file"" 
so I submitted the ""ipynb file"" 
but I sending the ""py file"" here for reference. ","student has .py file and we can not run .py and notebook file together on MOSS. Since she has .py file, I think it would be better for her to submit her .py file on canvas. Only .py file through canvas accepted. Please contact IT ASAP!"
"I can submit the py file but as I said I am not able to get a few results on the py file for some reason and that is the reason why I had to submit the ipynb file
If you want I can submit the py file if you want  ",Send the .py file please. Thanks. 
Can i send it on canvas i am not able to send it on the outlook ,"Yes, please submit on canvas as usual and we can not download any .py nor notebook file through this email system."
I am facing issues for logging in my stevens but was able to do it via canvas app on my phone. There might be confusion with the files. Hence submitting the files here as well for your review.I have also attached my IT ticket for the same.,"Please contact the IT ASAP, you may submit it on canvas by Tuesday 6:30PM, no late submission penalty for you."
"I am attaching the files again, plz let me know whether you can access it?","Hi, the email system does not allow us to download the .py file. "
"Thanks I will get back to you by tomorrow. Meanwhile, is it possible for you to check if you have received both of my files on canvas submission (final project & py).","Only PDF is available on canvas. Again, contact IT ASAP. "
I need a little more time to complete my final project. I’m trying to implement a different method and it’s taking me more time. Hope you understand my situation. ,I can give you 1 more day.
I apologize for missing the presentations I have a BSI quality audit going on at work this week that I am heavily involved in. I submitted the PowerPoint I put together on canvas. As for the code I have attached it to this email along with the csv file so you can run it. Let me know if you have any questions.,"Please submit through canvas, we can not download the .py file through emails. "
"For this assignment, the instructions tell us to list the top 5 courses, but the ""courses"" column call out sections and not the course as a whole, yet the instructions also list the ""courses"" that are open or closed. I want to verify if we are treating the ""courses"" call out in the instructions in part 1 as separate where when it states to list the top 5 courses, it means to list the top 5 ""Titles"" or the the Course capturing multiple sections, and in part 4 where its asking for the courses running at full capacity, it wants individual sections of the course labeled in the ""course"" column.","The dataset is organized by courses.
Each line/record/datapoint is a course. Consider each one as ""course"".
For example, EM 624A is a different course from EM 624WS.
For the 1st question which is asked to print five course with highest total student number, this is between 'Course' and 'Enrollment Count' not involved with 'Title'. For the 4th question which is asked for course with full capacity (closed) and not full capacity (open), this part you may use 'Section Status' and 'Course'. Both of these two task are not related to 'Title'."
"i have been having a lot of problems with my old laptop and connection issues (just moved). it was so bad that i have couldn't complete my some of my missing assignment, that, and my work schedule have been really packed with travelling for audits. would it be possible for me to turn my missing homework in for some points?","It’s not fair to other students and we do not have extra schedule to grade again, you should follow the course syllabus, which state the problem pretty clear. "
I wanted to propose a plan for the final semester project. I have attached the same for your review. Please let me know your feedback and if I can go ahead for the same and start working on it. I wanted to do the project I had sent for your review since I have a fintech background already in my previous work experience and I want to apply for finance based jobs in future as well. So I wanted to do something using python and it’s tools but also wanted this project to support my resume and it will help me fetching data jobs in finance firms,"Considering your particular case/interest, I would be OK having you working on a different project besides the ones we proposed. In order to approve it, I need to have 1. a specific description of the scope of the project and 2. the dataset you are going to use. The scope would be similar to what is in the description of the other projects. In particular, the questions you want to answer. Without those 2 elements, I cannot approve your project."
Please find attached the required description of the project proposal and kindly let me know your feedback on the same.,"Proceed with this project.
Please make sure the level of complexity of the analysis will be reflected by a Python script of a size not less than the very last assignments."
I didn’t receive grades for exercise 7&8. Could you please check that. Thank you.,EX07 is graded and available on canvas. EX08 is not graded yet.
"we are going to use Statista to find the number of mass shooting that happened before the pandemic, after, and during the pandemic. We will compare that number to see if there are any changes in that number during those times. We will also use Statista to find the top 5 news outlet used in the USA and analyze the outlook or opinions of those 5 news outlet. The goal is to analyze any biasness on what each news outlet think may cause the mass shootings this can directly correlate with public opinion as well and from the data gathered from Statista, we can analyze if these news outlook tone (sentiment) matches Statista's data (increase, decrease, or unchanged). example, is CNN downplaying mass shooting and does not think that it is a big deal when the data clearly shows that mass shooting is increasing each year or is FOX news overblowing mass shooting but from the data gathered, it remains unchanged.","This is an interesting topic to analyze. Make sure the data you have is substantial enough to make relevant analyses.
Statista has interesting datasets, but the free versions are most of the times limited."
"I've received a 0 for EX07 due to honest mistake by submitting the wrong files. 
Can you please allow me to submit the correct files? I also included 2 screenshots that shows a timestamp of when the files were last modified/worked on. Please see attached.  ","Yes, that would be fine. Please resubmit on canvas because we can not open the .py file through email.
Once you submitted, please email us that you have resubmitted."
"I'm just wanted to follow up on this. I've submitted the correct files on 04/15, were you able to see them in Canvas? ","Graded, report is good.
But you did not attach the 'Pros.txt' and 'Cons.txt' file, details refer to the commne on canvas.
Plus this is re-submit, we can not allow to re-re-submit, so your grade now is final grade."
"I have a question and require some guidance for ex08. To follow the procedure, I am appending my headlines into a list as follows: I am trying to remove the stopwords using this code, Later on the procedure asks for the sentiment of the entire headline, so I felt as if I could not break up the list of lists into one flat list. But, this is not removing all of the stop words, only some. Can you help give me guidance? I’ve attached the file as well.","I think you may refer to the following procedure.
create headline list
transform the word in the list into lower ones
remove stop word 
use the ' 'join(list) function (Professor Carlo mentioned in the previous email) to convert the list into string to prepare for the following word cloud."
"I hope you are well. I am very sorry for the last minute question on tonight’s homework. I am forwarding a question I posed to Shiyu in case you have any available before tonight’s class to help.
 
I am struggling to understand how to clean the headlines since they are framed into a list of lists (the list ‘headlines’ containing each headline as a separate list of words within itself). I was thinking about creating a flat list of all the words, but that would pose an issue when part 7. of the procedure asks for the sentiment of the headlines, so I must keep them intact.","Anyway, you can always go back and forth from list to strings.
Python has the join() method in one way and the string.split(""delimiter"") the other way."
"I plan on doing covid-19 US county data as my final project if nobody else has taken it yet. Additionally, tonight during class I know we didn’t get a chance to go over homework 11. Will you be posting the solution at some point?","OK for the Covid-19. Yes, I'll post the solution for HW11 by tomorrow and we'll eventually discuss it nexxt week."
I forgot to upload the report with my py file. Please find the attached report file in this mail. I assure you that this file was made on the day I uploaded my assignment. Kindly consider this as my last mistake. I will make sure that this doesn't happen again.,Okay. 
"I have been working on the EX07 assignment and I am very lost. I am not able to figure out the vader package, how to run the sentiment analysis, extract the bigram or create the word cloud. I have attended lecture, watched the recordings, reviewed samples and done my own research of outside sources and I do not know what to do. How should I proceed? ",
"I am currently working on EX08 and still do not understand or know how to use bigrams, word clouds or beautiful soup. I want to do well in this class but do not understand these topics.

"My groups which consist of Mina Shafik , Dean Manomat, and I, would like to do our project in mass shooting around the world in the last year and how it is portrayed in the media.
Please advise if this is appropriate. Are we allowed to analyze 'mass shooting'? ","It is OK working on a different topic, but you need to share the data source you are using and more details on what you want to achieve (1 short paragraph would be OK).
What you said ""mass shooting around the world in the last year and how it is portrayed in the media"" does not give me enough details."

"While reading the procedure for homework 10 I had a question about the bigrams.  Step 8 reads:

""Extract bigram, generating a separate list. Consider bigrams 2 words appearing together more than 2 times in the whole text. Bigrams will be like “word1_word2”, meaning you will create a new string composed by the 2 words, separated by an underscore (“_”)"". 

I wanted to confirm if we are supposed to be checking if each of the bigrams appears in the text of titles at least 2 times, or if we are using the entire list of bigrams that is generated.","if we consider all the bigrams, they will be way too many, being a full list of all the words.
As in the requirements, consider only ""2 words appearing together more than 2 times in the whole text”."
"I was looking at my grade for homework 8 and the comment says ""ocupations.csv' this file is not submitted which is used in the code"".  I realize that I completely forgot to attach the csv file I used to replace the occupations in my code.  Would I be able to resubmit the assignment and include the file to be considered for an adjustment to my grade?","yes, please, resubmit your assignment."
"I am trying to work on Assignment 07 but I am having problems with reading the txt file I have created. I keep getting the attached error message on python. I am unsure of how to find the unreadable character it is mentioning. Do you know how I can get around this? I have attached the txt file for reference as well.

Any tips on how I should prepare the txt file so it can be read by python?",You may use encode= “utf-8” to give a try or use other encoding. 
"I have a question about the midterm. For the first question in the code-checking portion of the midterm it states that “for every character in the original, there are two characters “ as the desired outcome. But in the example it says ‘The’à’TTThhheee’ which would be 3 characters for each original character. So in this case is the desired output ‘TTThhheee’ or just ‘TThhee’.",It should be ‘TTThhheee’ 
 I went to look at the midterm for EM 624 but do not see it posted.  I wanted to check when the midterm will be available/unlocked to start working on it.,The midterm has been published minutes ago.
I wanted to ask you if we need to exclude the count of all rows that have covid 19 as a primary disease for all parts of the assignment. It wasn't too clear in the procedure.,"I am not sure what do you mean, but please follow the description of the HW and the hint I just sent."
I noticed that when you went over the solution to HW 4 yesterday in class the assignment seemed slightly different than the assignment I did. You can see attached for the assignment I downloaded from Canvas. Was the assignment ever updated during the middle of the week? I know Canvas has been a little weird this semester so just want to make sure I am not missing something.  ,"The version of HW4 related to the code I presented yesterday was posted on Canvas on 2/14, that is the day the assignment was introduced to the class.
If you check the video recording for the class, you will see the current version, not the older one you sent to me. Just go to 1h21'18"".
Bottom line, HW4 has 3 parts, not 2.
We can be flexible this time, considering this as a misunderstanding, but in the future, please always check what is presented as assignment in class.

" re-downloaded my original submission from Canvas into a new folder and re-tested it.

This assignment runs fine on my machine, with or without the cache.txt file submitted. The report file .pdf also opens fine for me in three different programs, so it's hard to tell what the cryptic message above means.

Two things to consider, since this may be setup-related:

1) My submission uses the selenium driver for Chrome, not just the newspaper3k library.

While selenium was needed for the dynamic web content on the site I chose, I didn't want to make it a requirement for *you* to have to reproduce my results.

To that end, I had added a cache function that saves and reloads 'cache.txt' from disk (if it is present, i.e., the cached website content). The cache.txt file should allow you to quickly reproduce my results, exactly, with or without having the selenium driver installed. That was part of my original submission.

2) After review, it appears Canvas renamed all of my submission files with a '-1' suffix (maybe because it was submitted more than once? I don't remember). 'cache.txt' looks like it got renamed to 'cache-1.txt', and without finding 'cache.txt', the program runs from scratch and uses the selenium web driver.","The code may due to different environment configuration. The real problem is about your report, you just list your result without elaborate interpretation about the result. 
I have corrected the grade from 80/100 to 88/100, but your report lacks of interpretation."

"I am trying to do homework #8, but I am having some problems with the newspaper package. At first after trying to download it I was receiving an error ‘Pip install fails: SSL required.’
I have only received this error from the newspaper package, otherwise my pip installs have been fine. After googling around I tried
easy_install newspaper
and it said downloaded but in my IDE it still says No module named 'newspaper' .
 
I’m stuck here and was hoping for help. ","Great, Andrew

Thanks for letting me know.
I’m adding Shiyu in cc, to have her in the loop."
"I wanted some clarity on the following lines in the analyzing of time distribution of the research activities project, ""Once the list is extracted as return value in a set of web pages, the content can be scraped using a script. Content would be pdf files.
A relevant subset (10-20) of the total documents would be sufficient for the analysis.""","his is a 3 steps process:
download the files from different periods of time
analyze the document in each bucket/period of time (the means - among other - most frequent words, word clouds, sentiment, eventually networks)

"EM 624 Final, Missing Data File for People Migration
show quoted text
I have a personal interest in analyzing People Migration for the Final project, but I don't see the data file posted.

On a side note, there are five files described in the COVID section of the Word Doc--those all appear to be posted correctly--so after looking through each of them, I don't believe there is a naming issue or a simple mix-up like that.

I will continue looking around online, but I think I'm possibly either missing something, or maybe the file didn't post to Canvas correctly.","I published the files.

Sorry for the inconvenience!"
"
I was looking for the database required for project 1 (“Analyze People Migration Data”) on EM 624 on Canvas, and there is no database for this project. Four files and one pdf are available on Canvas (Data.png attached), and all are for the COVID-19 project (COVID.png attached). Please let me know if there is any data for this example.",All required data are in the list. Based on the project you chose you may find the corresponding data.
"I am not able to install any libraries on Pycharm. As a result, I am not able to do the assignments. I talked to Professor about this and he told me to approach you. Is it possible for us to meet and look into this?","Please refer to the following tutorial to install packages on pycharm, when I use pycharm in the beginning, I also refer to this kind of tutorials, they're very helpful.https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html#packages-tool-window.

"For my EM 624 final project, can I please work on analyzing NYC taxicab data? The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) publishes trip records in an open data format here. There are different files available on a monthly basis for yellow cabs, green/boro cabs and for hire vehicles (e.g. Uber, Lfyt). 

For my project, I would like to analyze a subset of this data. Some topics I would be interested in exploring include: analyzing all trips by yellow cabs last year (2021) or comparing Uber/Lfyt ridership to yellow/green cabs. Aside from being a topic of strong personal interest, I also believe that this project would expand on the knowledge I learned last semester from ES 660, Network Science, in analyzing network behavior in a real-world scenario. Additionally, this project would allow me to work with graphical data and plotting data on a map - a Python skill that I need to further refine. ","Please make sure you will submit the actual dataset you will use in your project along with the code and the report.

We need the dataset to test your code."
"The data uploaded to the TLC's website comes in a PARQUET file format, which I can convert and save as CSV for your review. There are thousands of records per file so it might not be ideal to view in a CSV format in Excel. However, I will make sure my code references the URL of the open source file directly so there is no need to download additional data... ","Are you going to work directly with the PARQUET format in your code?
If yes, the URL would work.
If you convert it in a csv and use it, then we need it/at least a subset of it to run your code."
"Yes, I intend on working with the PARQUET file format directly from the TLC's website. Pandas supports the fastparquet engine for reading PARQUET files directly into a DataFrame object. I will provide the URL(s) I use to obtain the data for my project.  ",OK!

"EX08 - Question # 8 & # 9
Does this mean if there are 10 headlines, there should be 10 sentiment analysis?",yes
"EX08 - Question # 8 & # 9
Thank you Shiyu,

That was super helpful.

I also had question regarding Q#7.

7. Looping into the list of clean headlines, print the headlines with the highest and lowest sentiment (3
each)

From the class, when Professor went over the sentiment, he referred to sentiment analysis which resulted in positive, neutral, and negative analysis. I think I'm not understanding what highest and lowest sentiment refer to. Is the question asking about the top 3 and least 3 common words?","I think the following link would be more helpful:

"EX08 - Question # 8 & # 9

Could you please elaborate on question #8 & #9?
For #8 Question asks: 'Consider bigrams 2 words appearing together more than 2 times in the whole text.'
For example, do you mean: ('apple', 'apple') or [('apple', 'orange'),('apple', 'orange')] ?

For # 9 Question asks: 'Merge the list of single words with the list of bigrams'
Does this mean the result should look something like:
[('apple', 'orange'),....,('apple_orange')] ?","8.Extract bigram, generating a separate list. Consider bigrams 2 words appearing together more than 2
times in the whole text. Bigrams will be like “word1_word2”, meaning you will create a new string
composed by the 2 words, separated by an underscore (“_”)
9. 9. Merge the list of single words with the list of bigrams

refer to question 8:
for example the sentence: ' I love to eat apple', 'I also love to eat orange':
bi gram for first sententce: I love, love to, to eat, eat apple.
bigram for second sentence: I also, also love, love to, to eat, eat orange.
among the bigrams, 'love to', 'to eat' appear twice, other bigram appear once. 

refer to question 9:
just merge single word with bigram list as one list "

I have a question regarding Exercise 7 for EM 624.

I have installed both wordcloud and vaderSentiment using pip install, however, when I import both in my code, I get an error message saying ""ModuleNotFoundError"".

Do you know why I am still getting an error message despite having both libraries installed?","Maybe you can check the interpreter and the console environment of your HW7 script, if the script is not in the environment that installed the package, you will get this type of error."

"I am emailing you inquiring if I could receive an extension on Homework EX07. I am about half way done with the assignment but struggling some. And with my other course loads I am not confident that I will be able to submit on time Tuesday. All of the past assignments I have been able to finish on time but I am struggling a bit on this one.

If an extension is not allowed I completely understand, however I could submit a much better version of the assignment if given the opportunity to submit Thursday.",Please make sure you will not use the solution I’ll present in class tomorrow.
"Can we use nltk module to solve the problem with combination of wordcloud, vader and matplotlib.

"I want to display all the charts created in a pycharm on the screen at once. Currently, whenever I use plt.show() after the chart or graph, the chart appears on the screen and I have to close it in order to display the next one. I searched on stack overflow, seaborn, Matplotlib docs and geeks for geeks but could not find relevant answer for the same. 
Can you please assist me in the same? Since in one of my previous assignments I could not display the bar plot and pie chart both on the screen simultaneously without using subplots. Like in Jupyter Notebook, all the charts remain on the screen without the need to close one to display the next one.","Matplotlib is not very “smart”.
Once you use a plt.show, you need to clear the figure using plt.clf() before generating/showing the next."
Hope you're doing good. Firstly I want to thank you for the prompt response to all queries. I have a doubt about exercise 06. There are a lot of n/a values in the dataset. What is to be done of those?,You can just drop them.

# Line Plot
# Label the x-axis with the years
# Label the y-axis ""ID""
